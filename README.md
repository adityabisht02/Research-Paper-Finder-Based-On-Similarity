<h2> Problem Statements and what this application tries to solve </h2>
1. While studying research papers, people often look for similar research papers to get further context or more information. <br>
2. However they have to manually search for these on google scholar and other platforms.<br>
3. The references section in a research paper can have as many as 30 references so the user will have to perform a lot of manual work to find the most similar research paper.

<h2> About the application </h2>
