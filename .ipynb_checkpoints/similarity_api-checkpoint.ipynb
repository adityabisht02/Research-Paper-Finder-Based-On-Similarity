The  key element  of  this  paradigm  is  the  novel  structure  of  the \\\\ninformation processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurons) working \\\\nin unison to solve specific problems. ANNs, like people, learn by example. An ANN is configured for a specific application, such \\\\nas pattern recognition or data classification, through a learning process. Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the \\\\nsynaptic connections that exist between the neurons. This is true of ANNs as well. This paper gives overview of Artificial Ne ural \\\\nNetwork, working & training of ANN. It also explain the application and advantages of ANN. \\\\n\"', 'abs2': 'Much of the information used by ecologists in modelling and decision making is imprecise. The imprecision arises both from data that are inexact or incomplete and from the use of ecological principles that are sometimes less than fully reliable and may be conflicting.
